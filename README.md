# Intro
This is a nextjs 14 app that uses typescript and tailwindCss

# Start up
In order to startup the project, get inside the root directory and run npm run dev, then follow the prompts that come up in the terminal

# Content
The app is in no way done, i have just put up a basic structure of it. i stopped at the login component part. getting the login function to run run a user clicks on login button after registering. Just a warning though, you will get an error there after clicking on the login button. Will be returning to fix it. But something just come up, hopefully.

# Outro
Will return back to this project hopefully, because its something i really like and see promise in it. But for now, want to turn m attention to a react-native tuts. Will be back.
